# Sound Files for Story Reader

This directory contains sound effects used in the Story Reader application. Currently, these are placeholder files and not actual MP3 sound files.

## ⚠️ Important Note

The placeholder files in this directory are not valid audio files. The application is set up to gracefully handle missing or invalid audio files, but you will need to add real MP3 files for the sound effects to work properly.

## Required Sound Files

1. **page-turn.mp3** - A gentle page turning sound effect for when users navigate between pages.
2. **good-choice.mp3** - A positive sound effect for when a user selects the "good" choice.
3. **bad-choice.mp3** - A different sound effect for when a user selects the "bad" choice.
4. **success.mp3** - A celebratory sound effect that plays when the user finishes the story.

## How to Add Sound Files

1. Obtain MP3 sound files (see "Resources" section below)
2. Rename them to match the filenames above
3. Place them in this directory, replacing the placeholder files
4. The application will automatically use your sound files when available

## Disabling Sounds

If you don't want to use sound effects, the application will continue to work without them. The code has been updated to gracefully handle missing or invalid sound files.

## Guidelines for Sound Selection

- Keep all sounds child-friendly and not too startling
- Sound effects should be short (1-2 seconds)
- Make sure they have appropriate volume levels
- Use MP3 format for best browser compatibility
- Aim for file sizes under 100KB each for fast loading
